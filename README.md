# gp_cross_factor
The goal of this project is to modify the existing gplearn package to enable specific three-dimensional structured dimension genetic programming (GP). The primary focus is to refine the package to facilitate cross-sectional factor investigation.

In the current version, the gplearn package only supports rankIC as the fitness metric. However, future enhancements will introduce additional functions and capabilities to broaden its functionality. Some of the planned improvements include:

Expanded Fitness Metrics: In addition to rankIC, the package will incorporate other fitness metrics such as quantile returns, monotonicity, and correlation within existing factors. This will allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of factors and improve the overall performance of the GP.

Enhanced Base Operators: The modified package will introduce a wider range of base operators, expanding the available functions for factor analysis. These additional operators will provide greater flexibility and enable more sophisticated analysis techniques.

By incorporating these improvements into the gplearn package, researchers and practitioners will have a more powerful tool at their disposal for exploring cross-sectional factor analysis. Stay tuned!
